# Wizarding Intern

A small mod for Rift Wizard 2 - apply for an intern! Teach her your basic spells! Take care of her! She looks up to you!

## Installation

Put the contents in a folder named "WizardingIntern" in your Rift Wizard 2 mods directory.

## Gameplay

Wizarding Intern is a Conjuration skill costing 5 SP. An intern is summoned every 10 turns if one does not exist, similar to the Chaos Familiar or Deathchill Familiar. Upon summoning, the intern learns all of your level 1 sorceries (this means that the base RW2 Wolf summon is not included - it seemed a little much!) and can cast them with 7-turn cooldowns.

Should your intern die, the next intern will arrive in ten turns... plus three turns for every intern that's died on the current level. They're a little skittish. Can you blame them? It's an *unpaid* internship.
